I like using my imagination to write stories about {noun1}, or {noun2}. \
I can write about people who are {num} feet tall, with {color} hair who can {verb}. \
When I write, I can be silly, serious, or {mood}. Making up stories about living in {place}, \
or being a {job}, where people can {verb2} can be so much fun. There are many types of writing, \
like poetry, {noun3}, and {noun4}. I'd like to be a writer when I grow up, \
and write {nouns1} for children about {ing_verb} in {nouns2}.")
